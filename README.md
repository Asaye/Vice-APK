An easy to use android app which executes selected phone activities at a future time on your behalf. The activities range from changing the state of the ringer volume, wifi or bluetooth to downloading a file from a given website and taking a selfie from a long distance. For some activities, the app reverses the scheduled activity if the "Duration" value is defined.

The app requires a number of permissions but they will only be asked if you want to defer an activity in need of that particular permission.
